I am studying for frontend heavy full stack roles. i have been studying React and Node and not I think I need to cover TypeScript. I have used it but am not prepared for interview style questions for a role where typescript is heavily used. Can you please give me a series of theoretical and then some practical (coding) questions that you might find in a typical mid-to-senior level frontend engineering interview? I will answer them one by one so don't give me the answers now. When I answer tell me what I did get right, and what I missed. Then technical details, and then a posished answer that I could say in an interview.
