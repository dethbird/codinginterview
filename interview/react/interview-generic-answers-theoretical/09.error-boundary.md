# 9. How would you handle **error boundaries** or async errors in React components?

## a
    I wrap the component that might throw an exception in an ErrorBoundary which catches the exception and does the desired thing with it, even just a "oops something happened". Error boundaries handle async errors in this way.

## A

Nice — that’s already the right shape of an answer: **Error Boundaries catch rendering errors and display fallback UI**. You’ve got the gist. Let’s make it crisp, technically correct, and include the nuances that usually separate a good answer from a great one.

### 💡 Interview-ready explanation

> An **Error Boundary** is a React component that catches **JavaScript errors during rendering**, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of its child components.
> It prevents those errors from unmounting the entire React tree by rendering a **fallback UI** instead — something like “Oops, something went wrong.”
>
> Error Boundaries implement two special lifecycle methods:
>
> ```tsx
> static getDerivedStateFromError(error)
> componentDidCatch(error, info)
> ```
>
> The first updates state so React can render a fallback; the second is used for logging or reporting.

### 🧠 Example

```tsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError() {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    console.error('Logged error:', error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) return <h2>Something went wrong.</h2>;
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

Then use it like:

```tsx
<ErrorBoundary>
  <UserProfile />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

### ⚠️ Clarifying the async part

> Error Boundaries **do not** catch errors in:
>
> * Asynchronous code (e.g. inside `setTimeout` or Promises)
> * Event handlers
> * Server-side rendering
> * Errors thrown inside the Error Boundary itself

For async or event-handler errors, you still need **try/catch** or error handling in your async logic:

```tsx
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const res = await api.get('/data');
  } catch (err) {
    setError(err);
  }
}
```

React 18+ and the upcoming “React Error Boundaries for async Suspense” features will improve this, but as of now, **Error Boundaries only catch render-phase errors**, not arbitrary async ones.

### 🗣️ Smooth phrasing for the interview

> “An Error Boundary is a React component that catches errors during rendering and shows a fallback UI instead of crashing the app. It only works for render-phase errors—not for async or event-handler errors, which you still handle manually.
> I use it to isolate risky parts of the tree, log errors, and keep the rest of the UI stable.”

You’re doing great — each answer’s getting tighter.
Next one in this theoretical batch is a good contrast: **“How do you optimize performance in a large React app?”**
