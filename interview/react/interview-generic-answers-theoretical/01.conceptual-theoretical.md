# 1. Conceptual / Theoretical Questions

## 1. What’s the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?

### a
    Controlled components use prop or state and user events to determine the render. Uncontrolled just take some optional props and render. 

### A

A controlled component’s value is fully managed by React state — Good start — you’ve got the essence, but let’s refine and deepen it so it sounds confident and “production-aware.”

Your answer captures that controlled components are driven by React state, but the interviewer will want to hear two key details: who owns the data and how updates flow.

How to tighten your answer:

A strong, interview-ready version would sound like this:

    A controlled component’s value is fully managed by React state — its “source of truth” lives in the component or its parent. Every user interaction triggers a state update, which causes a re-render and updates the UI.

    An uncontrolled component, on the other hand, keeps its own internal state inside the DOM. You typically use a ref to read values when you need them instead of responding to every onChange.

    Controlled components give you predictable behavior, validation, and synchronization with other UI, but at the cost of more re-renders. Uncontrolled components are simpler and sometimes more performant for things like form inputs where you don’t need constant control.
