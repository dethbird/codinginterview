# React Interview Practice — v2 (JS)

This pack is intentionally **incomplete**. Each challenge ships with failing or missing tests so you can TDD your way to green.

## Quickstart

```bash
npm i
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
# Local:   http://localhost:5173/
# Network: http://10.0.2.15:5173/   # (example)
# Visit the URL in your browser, then select a challenge from the dropdown.
npm test
# single test:
npx vitest watch src/challenges/small/02-char-count/*
```

## How it works
- Open the app → choose a challenge from the dropdown (or use `?challenge=small-01-use-countdown`).
- Implement the TODOs in each `index.jsx` until tests pass.
- Many tests are **red by design**. Fix or complete them as part of the exercise.
