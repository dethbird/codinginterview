# React Interview Practice — v2 (JS)

This pack is intentionally **incomplete**. Each challenge ships with failing or missing tests so you can TDD your way to green.

## Quickstart
```bash
npm i
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
# visit http://<vm-ip>:5173
npm run test:watch
```

## How it works
- Open the app → choose a challenge from the dropdown (or use `?challenge=small-01-use-countdown`).
- Implement the TODOs in each `index.jsx` until tests pass.
- Many tests are **red by design**. Fix or complete them as part of the exercise.
