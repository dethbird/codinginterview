# Small 03 — Star Rating
Build `<StarRating max={5} value={?} onChange(val) />`.

Requirements:
- Hover previews the rating (temporary highlight)
- Click commits the rating via onChange
- Keyboard: Arrow keys adjust value when focused

Bonus: support `value` prop as controlled; fall back to internal state if undefined.
