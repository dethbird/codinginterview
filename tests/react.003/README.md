# React Interview Practice — v3.1 (Stable Harness)

Same harness as v3 (deterministic). Differences:
- **Small #01 (useCountdown)** now has TODOs; tests start red.
- **Small #06 (Toggle List)** now has TODOs; tests start red.

## Quickstart
```bash
npm i
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
# Local:   http://localhost:5173/
# Network: http://10.0.2.15:5173/   # (example)
# Visit the URL in your browser, then select a challenge from the dropdown.
npm test
# single test:
npx vitest watch src/challenges/small/02-char-count/*
```
