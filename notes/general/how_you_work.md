Yes, this is very Meta-style—“move fast, bias toward action, simplify.” Let’s arm you with a few *story skeletons* you can adapt, grounded in your resume (Sony, Salesforce, Mailchimp contract, nonprofits, full-stack work with PHP/React/Node/GraphQL).

---

## How you “execute” (get things done)

**Framing:** Interviewers don’t want a timeline diary, they want proof you can cut through ambiguity, break work into increments, and deliver value. Use **STAR** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) but keep the *Result* measurable.

**Example (Mailchimp contract, UI + backend integration):**

* **Situation:** At Mailchimp, I was on a 6-month contract working on new campaign management tools.
* **Task:** Requirements shifted mid-project; designers were still exploring flows while engineering needed to deliver.
* **Action:** I created a prototype in React with mock GraphQL resolvers to let stakeholders click through end-to-end, even before real APIs were finalized.
* **Result:** That unblocked backend schema discussions and allowed the design team to iterate quickly. We ended up shipping on schedule because the early prototype surfaced mismatches early.
* **Takeaway:** I don’t wait for perfection; I ship a thin slice to align the team, then iterate.

## Dealing with incomplete specs

**Framing:** Show you clarify assumptions, find the “north star” outcome, and keep momentum instead of getting blocked.

**Example (Nonprofit projects / Salesforce era):**

* **Situation:** At a nonprofit client, they asked for a “dashboard” but couldn’t articulate what metrics mattered.
* **Task:** I needed to build something useful without endless discovery.
* **Action:** I interviewed three stakeholders to find the common denominator (donations, volunteer hours, and engagement). I sketched wireframes and walked them through options.
* **Result:** Within a week, we had a live PHP/SQL prototype showing key charts. Later we added filters and drill-downs, but the MVP already provided clarity.
* **Takeaway:** I handle vague specs by shipping a minimal, opinionated version quickly—then use feedback to converge.

## Collaboration

**Framing:** Stress that you align early, give visibility, and reduce surprises. Mention cross-functional work (design, PM, ops).

**Example (Sony Music / playlist systems):**

* **Situation:** At Sony Music Entertainment, we were modernizing parts of the playlist backend for The Orchard. Multiple teams across time zones.
* **Task:** My role was to expose a GraphQL API for internal tools, but requirements from product were vague (“make it faster and more reliable”).
* **Action:** I collaborated with ops and DBAs to identify real pain points (N+1 queries, slow joins). I proposed a caching layer (Redis) and wrote out data-access patterns in pseudo-GraphQL queries to communicate with frontend.
* **Result:** Performance improved by ~40% on hot queries, and front-end devs unblocked because they had stable schema contracts.
* **Takeaway:** I build alignment by showing work in a shared language (schemas, mocks, prototypes) instead of long spec docs.

## Simplification / bias toward action soundbites

* “When specs are unclear, I find the **smallest possible slice** we can all agree on, ship it, and iterate.”
* “I default to **prototypes and contracts**—mock APIs, wireframes, GraphQL schemas—so others can react to something concrete.”
* “I keep collaboration lightweight: async docs for visibility, quick check-ins for decisions, and automated tests as living documentation.”
* “My bias toward action shows up in how I’ll ship a rough cut early rather than polish in isolation.”

Would you like me to help you **package these into 2-minute spoken answers** (almost like scripts you can rehearse), or do you prefer keeping them as bullet-point “lego blocks” you can assemble on the fly?
