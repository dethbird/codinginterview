Yep—ReactPHP is worth knowing, especially if you’re asked about real-time or long-running processes in a PHP backend.

**ReactPHP basics**

* It’s a **low-level event-driven framework for PHP**.
* Think of it like Node.js for PHP: instead of PHP scripts starting and ending per request (classic Apache/PHP-FPM model), ReactPHP runs as a **long-lived process** that handles many events (I/O, timers, sockets) asynchronously.
* It uses an **event loop** at its core, so you can do non-blocking operations (like making HTTP requests, reading from sockets, or querying databases) without waiting for each one to finish before starting another.

**Why it matters**

* Regular PHP + FPM: each request spins up, runs, tears down. No persistent state, no native async.
* ReactPHP: single process stays alive, you can maintain connections (like WebSockets), schedule timers, stream data, or fan out parallel I/O.
* That makes it a good candidate for **GraphQL subscriptions**, chat servers, real-time APIs, daemons, microservices, or cron-like workers.

**Ecosystem bits**

* **react/http** → minimal async HTTP server.
* **react/socket** → TCP/UDP sockets.
* **react/event-loop** → the core loop.
* **react/stream** → async streams (files, network).
* **react/mysql / react/redis** → async DB drivers.

**Example sketch (HTTP server in ReactPHP):**

```php
<?php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$loop = React\EventLoop\Factory::create();
$server = new React\Http\Server(function (Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface $request) {
    return React\Http\Message\Response::plaintext(
        "Hello from ReactPHP at " . date('H:i:s')
    );
});

$socket = new React\Socket\SocketServer('127.0.0.1:8080');
$server->listen($socket);

echo "Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8080\n";
$loop->run();
```

That server stays up, handles many concurrent connections, and doesn’t spin up new PHP processes per request.

**Interview-ready takeaway**
ReactPHP is a **foundation for async, event-driven apps in PHP**, useful when you need long-lived processes (like WebSocket servers for GraphQL subscriptions), streaming I/O, or parallel async tasks—things the traditional request/response PHP model doesn’t handle well.

Would you like me to compare ReactPHP with **Swoole**, since interviewers sometimes ask how they differ in the PHP async ecosystem?

Yes—it’s not a new runtime like “Node.js vs JavaScript,” it’s a **library ecosystem** you install on top of regular PHP.

* You still run **normal PHP** (≥7.1, 8.x recommended).
* ReactPHP is pulled in via **Composer**:

  ```bash
  composer require react/event-loop react/http
  ```
* Then you write PHP code against ReactPHP’s event loop and APIs.

So it’s not a separate binary or a patched PHP interpreter. It’s “just PHP,” but you run it differently:

* Instead of executing a file and exiting (CLI mode), your script starts the **event loop** and keeps running indefinitely, listening for events.
* That means you don’t run it behind Apache+mod_php or PHP-FPM. You’d launch it as a standalone process, like:

  ```bash
  php server.php
  ```
* You might manage it with **supervisord**, **systemd**, or Docker to keep it alive—similar to how you’d run a Node.js server.

**In short:**
ReactPHP = standard PHP + Composer packages + event loop style of programming. You don’t replace PHP, you extend how it’s used.

Would you like me to show you how **GraphQL subscriptions** would look if implemented with ReactPHP’s `react/http` + `websockets` packages, so you can see the connection?
